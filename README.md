N64
===
<br />
N64 Bare Metal Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the official Psy-Q N64 MIPS assembler:<br />
ASMN64<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to gbaguy/n64guy/asmguy, who with his tutorials, helped me get into N64 Coding =D<br />
Please check out cen64, a cycle accurate N64 Emulator by MarathonMan, & his RSP Assembler:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.N64) file.<br />
Using ASMN64 Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real N64 using a 64drive Cartridge by Retroactive:<br />

You can also use N64 emulators like cen64 & the MESS N64 Driver.
